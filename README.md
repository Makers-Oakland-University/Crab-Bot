Crab-bot is a fun interactive robot running on 4 motors and mecanum wheels. He waves his hands wherever he goes and brings joy to everyone around him.

## Technical Description 
### Crab-bot Version 1 
Crab-bot is built around the Arduino Mega which interfaces to 4 dedicated motor drivers, one for each wheel. An xbox controller is used as user input to drive crab bot. Two servos run crab-bot's claws. 

### Crab-bot Version 2
We're currently working to rebuild and re-imagine crab-bot with the ESP32 at his core to make room for additional features. New crab-bot will include all the features of the original crab-bot with the addition of: more sounds, neopixel lights, and pre-programmed maneuvers/dance. All with a focus on leaving space for additional hardware and features in the future that anyone in makers can add!

This repo contains all the source code/files used in crab-bot
